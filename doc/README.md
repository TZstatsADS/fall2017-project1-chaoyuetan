### Doc folder

The doc directory contains the report or presentation files. It can have subfolders.  


What does my project do?

- There have been nearly a dozen one-term presidents who ran for second terms but were denied by voters, but only three one term presidents since World War II. The most recent one term president who lost his re-election bid was George H.W. Bush, a Republican who lost to Democrat Bill Clinton in 1992.

- How about our current president? Will Trump win again if he runs for the second term? My project focused on America's one term presidents - those who ran for, but lost, re-election - through history, and conducted data mining and visualization from those inaugural speeches.

- According to my result, I found there are some similarity between Trump's and other one-term presidents' speeches.

Outline structure of my code

- First, checked libraries needed to be installed and the R notebook environmental settings.

- Then, read in inaugural speeches and did data pre-processing(prepare president list). Generated Term-Document Matrix and Document-Term Matrix.

- Next, inspected wordcloud, conducted sentiment analysis.

- Last, conducted emotion analysis, classification and visualization.

How to run my code

- Be sure to install all the libraries in the right version and check if it's the right version of R

- Download all the folders(data) from github
